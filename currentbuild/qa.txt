WARNING: StructureDefinition/mal-patient: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[8].type[0].profile[0]: There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-citizenship'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '5.2.0', found versions: 4.0.1, 5.2.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-citizenship' to 'http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/patient-citizenship|5.2.0'
