# Norwegian Laboratory Codebook (NLK) - FHIR Implementation Guide

Welcome to the FHIR Implementation Guide for the **Norsk Laboratoriekodeverk (NLK)** - Norway's comprehensive laboratory terminology standard.

## Purpose

This Implementation Guide publishes the Norwegian Laboratory Codebook as a standardized FHIR R4 CodeSystem, enabling Norwegian healthcare systems to use consistent, interoperable laboratory terminology across different platforms and vendors.

The NLK CodeSystem provides a complete, authoritative terminology for laboratory medicine in Norway, covering all major medical domains with **11,391 unique laboratory codes**.

## CodeSystem Structure

The following diagram illustrates the core structure of the Norwegian Laboratory Codebook as a FHIR CodeSystem:
