## 🔧 Generation

These sample files are automatically generated when you run:

```bash
# From the scripts directory
python example_csv_validation.py
```

The script creates fresh sample data each time it runs, demonstrating:

- Common Excel-to-CSV conversion problems
- Various data quality issues
- Validation and cleaning workflows

## 💡 Purpose

This sample data is designed to showcase:

- **Data Quality Issues**: Real-world problems found in Excel-converted CSV files
- **Validation Capabilities**: What the CSV quality validator can detect
- **Automatic Fixes**: Which issues can be resolved automatically

- ✓ Invalid formats (emails, etc.)
- ✓ Various null value representations

## 🚀 Usage

Use these sample files to:

1. **Learn** about CSV validation workflows
2. **Test** validation script modifications
3. **Demonstrate** data quality improvements
4. **Understand** common data problems and their fixes

These files serve as a reference for what clean, validated CSV data should look like after processing.
